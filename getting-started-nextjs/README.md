# Getting Started with Metaplex and Next.js

This example sets up a new React app with Metaplex using Next.js.

This example has been generated using the following steps:

1. **Create a new project using Next.js.**

   ```sh
   npx create-next-app@latest getting-started-nextjs
   cd getting-started-nextjs
   ```

2. **Install the Metaplex and the Solana SDKs.**

   ```sh
   yarn add @metaplex-foundation/js @solana/web3.js
   ```

3. **That's it!** 🎉

   You're now ready to start building your app. You can use the following commands to build and serve your app.

   ```sh
   # Build and serve for development.
   yarn dev

   # Build and serve for production.
   yarn build && yarn start
   ```
