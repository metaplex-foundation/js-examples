# Getting Started with Metaplex and CRA 4

This example sets up a new React app with Metaplex using "Create React App" (CRA) version 4 — i.e. using Webpack 4. Note that, if you're starting a new project, [we recommend using CRA 5](../getting-started-react-cra5) which uses Webpack 5.

This example has been generated using the following steps:

1. **Create a new project using the "Create React App" command.**

   ```sh
   npx create-react-app getting-started-react-cra4 --scripts-version 4.0.3
   cd getting-started-react-cra4
   ```

2. **Install the Metaplex and the Solana SDKs.**

   ```sh
   npm install @metaplex-foundation/js-next @solana/web3.js
   ```

3. **Install and use `react-app-rewired`**.

   This enables us to override some Webpack configurations in the next step.

   ```sh
   # Installs react-app-rewired.
   npm install react-app-rewired

   # Replaces "react-scripts" with "react-app-rewired" in package.json scripts.
   sed -i '' 's/react-scripts /react-app-rewired /g' package.json
   ```

4. **Override Webpack 4 configurations.**

   Create a new file to override Webpack 4 configurations.

   ```sh
   touch config-overrides.js
   ```

   Copy the following code inside the new `config-overrides.js` file.

     <summary>Why?</summary>
     If we skip this step, running `npm start` will fail, complaining that it can't resolve `.mjs` files provided by the Web3.js library. To fix this, we need to help Webpack resolve `.mjs` files by adding an extra rule.
   </details>

   ```js
   module.exports = function override(webpackConfig) {
     webpackConfig.module.rules.push({
       test: /\.mjs$/,
       include: /node_modules/,
       type: "javascript/auto",
     });
     return webpackConfig;
   };
   ```

5. **Update your browser requirements.**

   Update the `browserslist` object of your `package.json` to include the following production requirements.

   <details>
     <summary>Why?</summary>
     If we skip this step, building and serving your app for production will give us the following error in the console.

   ```
   Uncaught TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number
   ```

   This is because Webpack will try to change the code of the deprecated nested dependency `noble-ed25519` to make sure it works on browsers that don't support `BigInt`. However, [all modern browsers support `BigInt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt#browser_compatibility) so we can fix this by updating the `browserslist` object in our `package.json`.
   </details>

   ```diff
   "browserslist": {
     "production": [
   -     ">0.2%",
   -     "not dead",
   -     "not op_mini all"
   +     "chrome >= 67",
   +     "edge >= 79",
   +     "firefox >= 68",
   +     "opera >= 54",
   +     "safari >= 14"
     ],
       "development": [
       "last 1 chrome version",
       "last 1 firefox version",
       "last 1 safari version"
     ]
   },
   ```

6. **That's it!** 🎉

   You're now ready to start building your app. You can use the following commands to build and serve your app.

   ```sh
   # Build and serve for development.
   npm start

   # Build and serve for production.
   npm run build && serve -s build
   ```

   If you're interested in how this example app is using the Metaplex SDK, check out the [`App.js`](./src/App.js) and [`App.css`](./src/App.css) files in the `src` directory.
